# Problem List

- Given two vectors arr1[] and arr2[] of size m and n sorted in increasing order. Merge the
two arrays into a single sorted array of size m+n.
- Given a vector arr[] sorted in increasing order of n size and an integer x, find if there exists
a pair in the array whose sum is exactly x.
- Given a vector arr[] sorted in increasing order of n size and an integer x, find if there exists
a pair in the array whose absolute difference is exactly x.
- Given a vector arr[] sorted in increasing order. Return an array of squares
- Given a vector arr[] sorted in increasing order of n size and an integer x, find the number
of unique pairs that exist in the array whose absolute sum is exactly x.
- Given a vector array nums, print the count of triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such
that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == x. Where k is an integer
given by the user.
`  Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets and should not have 3 loops.`
